## Flood It

In the game Flood It, there is a grid of coloured squares and the user's objective is to fill the entire grid with one colour. Each turn, the user can "flood" every cell connected to the top left corner of the grid with a single colour. All cells connected to the top right corner is changed to the designated colour. For two cells to be connected, they must have the same colour and be adjacent vertically or horizontally. The objective of the user is to do flood the entire grid in the least number of turns.

This problem belongs to the set of [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) problems meaning it is very difficult to find an exact solution.
