Hello, my name is Duncan. I am undergraduate student at the [University of Western Ontario](http://www.uwo.ca/) studying computer science and business. I am an aspiring software engineer, and some of my interests in the area of software/computing include

1. **Clever algorithms**: I really like learning about algorithms and being introduced to new types of problems in computer science.
2. **Data analytics**: I am not a statistician, but I like work involving drawing insights from large amount of data.

Don't even get me started on using clever algorithms to analyze data!

My preferred "medium" is the web, as you have probably noticed from the projects presented in my portfolio. That being said, I wouldn't call myself a web developer as I only have experience creating the small Javascipt application you see here. I don't have any experience creating full-fledged sites. Nevertheless, Javascript is one of my favourite languages, and I love web technologies.
